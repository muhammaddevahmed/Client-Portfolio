        <p>Zima, a well-known alcoholic beverage from the 90s, faced significant challenges and struggled to find a
          leading audience, which led to it being discontinued. It began Zima as a new study to explore how branding and
          user experience impact a product's success.By implementing cutting-edge technologies and a mobile-first
          approach, we've developed a solution that performs exceptionally across all devices.</p>
        <p>My goal was to reimagine Zima for today's market by focusing on U2 research, UI/UX design, and reloading. I
          wanted to make it feel modern, healthier, and more appealing.</p>

          <p>Through extensive user interviews and testing sessions, we discovered that 78% of potential customers found
            the original Zima branding confusing. Participants reported difficulty understanding who the product was for
            and what made it unique in the market. Our research revealed three key pain points: unclear messaging,
            outdated visual design, and lack of digital presence.</p>
          <p>We conducted 15 in-depth interviews with both former Zima drinkers and new potential customers. The
            feedback consistently showed that while there was nostalgia for the brand, the product needed modernization
            to appeal to today's consumers. Users wanted clearer communication of ingredients and flavor profiles.</p>
          <p>The final insight showed that modern drinkers prioritize transparency and authenticity in alcoholic
            beverages, which became our guiding principle for the redesign.</p>

            <p>Original Zima was perceived as either too sweet or too bland by modern drinkers. Our taste tests revealed
              a preference for more complex, less sugary profiles.The 5% ABV was acceptable to most, but the alcohol
              taste needed better integration with flavor. This led to our new brewing process.</p>

              these dated perceptions.The "clear malt beverage" category itself caused confusion. Participants weren't
              sure how it differed from beer or cocktails.We found significant discomfort around ordering Zima in social
              situations. </p>
